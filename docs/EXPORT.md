# Original-code exports

`code-full/` is the comparison input. Files are keyed by entry address, for
example `FUN_0041D0C0.disassembled.txt`, regardless of the function name.

For an annotated function, export directly from the retail PE:

```sh
make export-asm
make export-asm EXPORT_ASM_FLAGS=--discover
make export-asm EXPORT_ASM_FLAGS=--clean
```

This path uses `/* Function start: 0xADDR */` annotations and produces the
disassembly needed by `compare-func`, `report`, and `order`.

For a complete refresh, run binary-comp's
[`ExportToCompile.java`](https://github.com/gg-sl-oss/binary-comp/blob/main/ghidra_scripts/ExportToCompile.java)
from Ghidra and point it at `code-full/`. That export also preserves Ghidra
names and writes the decompiled files, `globals.h`, and `strings.txt` required
by call/global audits.

| Command | Required input |
| --- | --- |
| `make compare-func`, `report`, `order` | Disassembly exports, linked `WC1.EXE`, `WC1.map` |
| `make verify-calls` | Decompiled exports too |
| `make verify-globals` | `code-full/globals.h` too |
| `make compare`, `compare-functions` | Retail and rebuilt executables |
