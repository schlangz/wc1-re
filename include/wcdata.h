/*
 *  Game data enumerations and on-disk record layouts.
 *
 *  Sources, in descending order of trust:
 *
 *  1. THIS BINARY.  Anything marked "verified" was read out of WC1.EXE itself,
 *     usually from an ordered string table.  Where the community documentation
 *     and the binary disagree, the binary wins and the difference is noted.
 *  2. WCMissionTools (../WCMissionTools), a MODULE/CAMP/BRIEFING parser built
 *     from the data files.  It names the fields the game loads; it does not
 *     know what the code calls them.
 *  3. WingCommanderArduinoBridge (../WingCommanderArduinoBridge), which reads
 *     the DOS build's memory live.  Its offsets are DOS-segment relative and do
 *     NOT apply here, but the field ORDER within the pilot record does, because
 *     both builds compile the same struct.
 *
 *  The MODULE record layouts below are the ON-DISK format.  The in-memory
 *  tables are different sizes -- the per-object table at 0x0046C97A has a
 *  0x36-byte stride against the 42-byte disk ship record, and the nav table has
 *  a 0x1F-byte stride against the 77-byte disk nav record -- so a disk field
 *  offset is a hint about what exists, never about where it lives at runtime.
