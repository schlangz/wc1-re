# Wing Commander source reconstruction and SDL2 port

This project recreates the source of **Wing Commander** as shipped in *Wing
Commander: The Kilrathi Saga* (1996). The reconstructed game core is C, the
`ix` audio library is C++, and the reference build uses Microsoft Visual C++
4.20 to reproduce the original Win32 executable as closely as possible.

A native SDL2 port is available for Windows, Linux, and macOS. It supports
Kilrathi Saga data and has partial support for the original DOS game data.

No copyrighted game data is included.

## Status

All 1,472 identified functions are accounted for: 1,470 have source
implementations and the remaining two are compiler-generated jump thunks that
must not be recreated manually.

`make report` calculates per-function machine-code similarity to the retail
executable; those scores measure reconstruction fidelity, not gameplay
completeness.

## Similarity

Run `make report` for the current per-function results. Generated report output
is not stored in this repository.

## Download and run the SDL2 port

Download the archive for your platform from
[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/neuromancer/wc1-re/releases). Extract its
contents into an installed Kilrathi Saga or DOS Wing Commander directory and
keep the bundled runtime libraries beside the executable. Start it with that
directory as the working directory:

```sh
# macOS or Linux
cd /path/to/WC1
./wc1-modern
```

```powershell
# Windows PowerShell
cd C:\path\to\WC1
.\wc1-modern.exe
```

With DOS data, compressed packet resources, OriginFX/AdLib music, and
synthesized sound effects work; other DOS-specific data or behavior may not.

### Fixes and features

What the port adds on top of the reconstructed game. The first group is always
active; the rest need a switch, and switches can be combined.

| Fix or feature | Enable with |
| --- | --- |
| Runs from either Kilrathi Saga or DOS game data, detected automatically | always on |
| Resizable window, fullscreen toggle, and mouse capture | always on |
| Aspect-correct 4:3 presentation and pointer mapping | always on |
| Camera-relative left/right panning for in-flight sound effects | always on |
| Background planets drawn with correct per-object scaling (WCDX fix) | always on |
| Static on knocked-out cockpit displays, which the 1996 port dropped | always on |
| Landing on the *Tiger's Claw* from any bearing; retail also required the Claw's bow to face you | always on |
| Mouse wheel throttle control during spaceflight | always on |
| `Esc` pauses during spaceflight, where the original left it inert | always on |
| Pointer confined only during unpaused, focused spaceflight | always on |
| Gamepad support with automatic SDL mappings and hot-plug | always on |
| OpenGL renderer drawing space objects at output resolution | `--enhanced` |
| Restored, music-synchronized startup intro | `--enhanced`, or automatic with DOS data |
| OriginFX intro music | `--enhanced`, or automatic with DOS data |
| Heavy-weapon, damage, collision, and afterburner rumble | `--joystick-rumble` |
| WCAT-style four-button joystick layouts | `--joystick-mode=4button-2axis` or `4button-4axis` |
| Alternate twin-stick, HOTAS, throttle, and rudder axis layouts | `--joystick-axes=<layout>` |
| Joystick diagnostics on stderr | `--joystick-debug` |
| Frame-rate counter | `-f` |
| Cockpitless view | `-c` |

```sh
./wc1-modern --enhanced --joystick-rumble
```

### Enhanced renderer

The OpenGL renderer keeps the original indexed artwork, palettes, cockpit, and
HUD; only space objects are redrawn at output resolution. The software renderer
remains the default.

### SDL2 port controls

| Shortcut | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `Cmd+Enter` (macOS) | Toggle fullscreen |
| `Alt+Enter` (Windows and Linux) | Toggle fullscreen |
| `Cmd+Q` (macOS) | Quit the game |
| Gamepad Start (spaceflight) | Pause or resume |
| Gamepad Back | Escape/back |
| Gamepad Y (`Y/N` prompts) | Confirm Yes |
| Mouse wheel (spaceflight) | Increase or decrease speed |
| `Esc` (spaceflight) | Pause; press any key to resume |

`Esc` pausing is a port addition. The original leaves it inert during
spaceflight, and there is no in-flight quit or restart: a mission ends only
by landing on the *Tiger's Claw*, ejecting, or dying. Quitting is done from
the barracks menu (*Quit Wing Commander*), and retrying a mission means
saving to a bunk beforehand and reloading it from there.

The default `--joystick-mode=original` keeps the original two-axis, two-button
controls. Two WCAT-style layouts are also available:

| Option | Spaceflight controls |
| --- | --- |
| `--joystick-mode=4button-2axis` | Buttons 1–4: fire, missile, afterburner, roll/throttle modifier |
| `--joystick-mode=4button-4axis` | Buttons 1–4: fire, missile, afterburner, cycle target; extra axes control roll and throttle |

On mapped controllers, buttons 1–4 correspond to A, B, X, and Y; hold X to
engage the afterburner.

In either WCAT-style mode, LB/RB cycle guns and missiles, LT/RT or the
left/right stick clicks open navigation/map and engage autopilot, and the
D-pad provides full speed, stop, communications, and target lock.

With communications open, D-pad Up/Down moves the highlighted choice, Right
selects it, and Left closes the list. Flight and weapon controls remain active.

The four-axis mode defaults to `--joystick-axes=twin-stick-roll`. Additional
twin-stick, HOTAS, throttle, and rudder layouts are described in
[the SDL2 port documentation](docs/SDL2.md#joystick-input).

## Build from source

Clone the submodules first:

```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### SDL2 port

Install a C/C++ compiler plus the SDL2 and LZO2 development packages, then run:

```sh
make -j modern
```

The executable is written to `out-modern/wc1-modern` (or
`out-modern/wc1-modern.exe` on Windows). `make run-modern` launches it with
Kilrathi Saga data in `data/full`; `make run-modern-dos` uses DOS data in
`data/dos`.

### Reconstructed Win32 build

The default target builds `WC1.EXE` with the original MSVC 4.20 toolchain under
wibo:

```sh
make -j
```

To run it, provide a Kilrathi Saga disc image. The Makefile extracts the game
data, substitutes the reconstructed executable, downloads DREAMM when needed,
and launches it in an emulated Windows 95 environment:

```sh
make run WC1_ISO=/path/to/kilrathi-saga.iso
```

Use `make debug WC1_ISO=/path/to/kilrathi-saga.iso` to start DREAMM's debugger.

## Reconstruction workflow

[`binary-comp`](https://github.com/gg-sl-oss/binary-comp) is required only for
comparison and verification commands:

```sh
python3 -m pip install "binary-comp[all] @ git+https://github.com/gg-sl-oss/binary-comp.git"
make compare-func FUNC=perform_maneuver
make verify
```

These commands require the retail executable at `data/full/WC1.ORI.EXE` and the
original-code exports under `code-full/`.
